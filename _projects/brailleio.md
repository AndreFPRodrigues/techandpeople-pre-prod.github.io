## Braille on Mobile Devices
In our work we have explored how to integrate Braille input and output mechanisms for smartphones. The lack of tactile and kinesthetic feedback on a touchscreen results in a slow typing process. Braille input has enabled faster nonvisual entry speeds on mobile touchscreen devices.

Overall, since the advent of touchscreen mobile devices, numerous input methods have been proposed for blind people. Braille chording approaches have been particularly effective in improving typing speed at the cost of accuracy. Furthermore, we continue to explore how to improve input accuracy, adapting suggestions, edit and corrections mechanisms to the nuances of chord base input.
