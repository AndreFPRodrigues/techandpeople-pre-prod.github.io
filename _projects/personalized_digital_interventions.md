## Nutriventures
To implement parent interventions that promote healthy CDP, we need acceptable, cost effective, easy to disseminate, culturally adapted programs. Web-based interventions may combine several methods to provide tailored information, prompt individual goal setting, promote reactive self-monitoring with individual feedback and offer tailored modeling. eHealth interventions showed good acceptability and feasibility in involving parents to change CDP. Our team has relevant experience in the development of user-friendly platforms allowing the individualization of psychological intervention. Moreover, and in spite of high participation rates for web-based programs, we need to explore what parental dimensions predict dropouts. With this aim, through a set of participatory design sessions with dietists, psychologists and parents we seek to design a brief mobile web-based intervention directed  to parents of 2-to-6 year-old children.
