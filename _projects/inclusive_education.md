## Computational Thinking learning for young visually impaired children
Learning to program is common in primary schools and kindergartens but current approaches are highly visual and not accessible to blind children.  We seek to understand together with IT and special needs educators, what are the qualities of current approaches and which ones are missing to adapt and design tangible and spatial inclusive robot-based programming environments.

## Math learning for young visually impaired children
We developed iCETA, an inclusive interactive system for math learning, that enables children to autonomously engage and solve additive composition tasks. It was designed through a set of participatory sessions with visually impaired children and their educators, and supports math learning through the combination of tangible interaction with haptic and auditory feedback. Tangible blocks representing numbers 1 to 5 were used to add or subtract and correctly solve the task embedded in a computerized game. Our approach aims to provide better scaffolding for understanding the abstract concept of a number by working with different representations of that number, such as the size of a block, Braille, color and audio feedback
