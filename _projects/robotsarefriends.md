## Robots & Health
In our work we always start by engaging with local communities, including them in the definition of the research project and in the design process. 
One example is our work with different dementia professionals, informal and formal caregivers, and people with dementia themselves. 
In it, we have explored how an autonomous robot (Maty) can be leveraged to engage in dialogue with a person with dementia and how to promote conversations with their families.

In another project, we are currently exploring how a carrier robot can break the physical barrier between rooms in a care facility.
Often, institutionalized seniors stay in the living rooms where they usually are. We enable older people program the carrier robot actions through small nestable pieces, the robot then moves and carries out its actions in a connected room with other older adults.
Users can record voice messages, send cookies/candies and play music, and were able to view reactions via webcams. The goal with this project is to stimulate group interaction between physicaly seperate groups of older adults.

## Robots & Accessibility
Robots in accessibility have been limitedly explored outside the domain of supporting orientation and mobility. We have started to explored how robots can be leverage to promote inclusion and indepence. 
In a first work, we contributed to the area of human-robot interaction and accessibility by bringing new insights on the 
collaboration between people and robots. Particularly, 1) we provided knowledge on the acceptance, perceived usefulness, foreseen scenarios, 
and concerns regarding the inclusion of robots in blind people daily lives; and 2) 
we inspected the collaboration betweena robot (Baxter)and blind participants in an assembly task, paying particular attention to the effect of two 
different forms of collaboration in participantâ€™s success on the task and on the engagement with the robot.
