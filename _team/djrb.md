I have completed my BSc in 2016 and my MSc in 2018, both on Informatics Engineering.
During my second year on Masters I have worked with data-driven healthcare for capturing and showing with rich visualization Parkinson's patients fluctuations throught the day.
During that time I had my first contact with research, I have build DataPark, a platform with the focus on rich visualization of data collected in free-living.
After that I have been continuously working with DataPark improving what I already have done and focus also on clinical evaluation.
In 2019 I have started my PhD that will focus on Parkinson'Disease. More precisely my research goal is to improve the informaton available for both clinicians and patients.
