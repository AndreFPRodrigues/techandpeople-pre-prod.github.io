I am an Industrial Designer and Academic Researcher focused on IoT technology and Human-Robot Interaction studies regarding the perception of the impact and acceptance in humans. For this, my approach is essentially User-Centered Design and Research Through Design. I am currently finishing my MSc where the main topic is the development of a small robot to help people with Alzheimer's in their routine management.
