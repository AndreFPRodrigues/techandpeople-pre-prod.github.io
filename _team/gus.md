I have successfully finished a BSc degree in Marine Biology in the University of Algarve - my last year thesis consisted in developing an algae ortholog genes database. Now I am in a MSc degree in Data Science in the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon learning substantially about predictive models and databases.

I have an interest to apply Machine Learning models in areas such as disease prediction and working in LASIGE is allowing me to do that.
