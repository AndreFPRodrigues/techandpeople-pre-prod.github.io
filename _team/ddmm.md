I'm a PhD candidate and HCI researcher, specializing in usable security and privacy. Currently, my research is focused on understanding unauthorized access to mobile devices.

I also regularly work on HCI methodology, and other HCI application areas, like accessibility.

I'm advised by [Luis Carrico](https://ciencias.ulisboa.pt/en/perfil/lmcarrico) and [Tiago Guerreiro](https://tjvguerreiro.github.io/).
