I completed my BSc degree in informatics engineering at Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon (2017) and I'm currently a MSc student at the same institution. My research is focused on the detection of physical intrusions on smartphones through the analysis of the user's semantics. My main interests are general Android and video games development.
