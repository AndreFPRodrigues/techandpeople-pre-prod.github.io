I completed my BSc degree in Equipment Design at the Faculty of Fine Arts in University of Lisbon. Currently, I am a MSc student in Informatics at the Faculty of Sciences in University of Lisbon. My research is about tangible interfaces for education, focused in tactile representations and interactions for visually impaired and blind children. My main interests are in product design, usability and human computer interaction.
