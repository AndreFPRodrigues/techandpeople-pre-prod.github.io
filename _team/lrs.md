I completed my BSc degree in Computer Science at Federal University of São João del Rei, Brazil (2016). Currently, I am an MSc student at University of São Paulo, Brazil. My research is about using elements of gamification to increase engagement and improve learning in children with autism. This project is developed in collaboration with Prof. Tiago Guerreiro from University of Lisbon, Portugal. My main interests are Gamification, Informatics in Education and Human-Computer Interaction.
