I am currently on the second year of my MSc degree on Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon, after finishing my BSc degree in Molecular and Genetic Biology with a minor in Informatics, in 2018 in the same school.

I will be working on my thesis at LASIGE focusing on developing a non-visual cognitive evaluation toolkit.
