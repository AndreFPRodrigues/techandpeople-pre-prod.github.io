I completed my computer engineering degree in 2018 in Informatics Engineering at University of Évora and I’m currently finishing my MSc degree in Informatics Engineering at Faculty of Science of the University of Lisbon.

During my MSc thesis I’m going to work on the project NutriVentures: Gamifying the Eating Habits of Young Children.

I am currently working in AlentApp headquartered in Évora. My main tasks are programming information systems developed mainly in PHP, Javascript, Jquery languages.
