I am an HCI reseacher with focus on improving access to computing technologies to people with different abilities, and on re-designing interactions and workflows for pervasive healthcare. Alongside, I am concerned with how people, in general, are able to secure their data, particularly from non-sophisticated insiders. I do all this with a strong user- and data-driven approach, pillared by deploying and assessing technological artifacts in-the-wild (i.e., in the real world). I am proud to be collaborating with institutions for blind people for over 12 years, with weekly engagements and prototypes being used for periods over 8 years; and with care homes, clinical centres and hospitals, in the last five years, with longitudinal (and still ongoing) deployments of our prototypes. I also seek to have near-term impact in the life of the populations I work with by deploying functional prototypes, making them available (e.g., Braille21), or by training people in using technology.

I am a Professor of Computer Science at Faculdade de CiÃªncias da Universidade de Lisboa and a researcher at LASIGE, where I coordinate the Accessibility and Aging Research Line.
