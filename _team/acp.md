I am a cognitive psychologist with experience in multidisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Currently, I am a PostDoc Researcher in LASIGE, Faculty of Science, University of Lisboa. In our projects, we emphasize participatory design, user-centered design and the use of multimodal interactive systems. We personalize and tailor digital interventions to enable a greater behavioural change and adherence to the treatment or training.
Great part of my work has been to create cognitive and educational tools to foster the acquisition of core skills, such as executive functions, mathematics and computational thinking in younger children- sighted and visually impaired children. We use multisensory environments combining tangible interaction with digital auditory feedback, to enable blind children to take benefits from both real and virtual worlds.
We also apply inclusive multisensory systems in other domains, as for instance, in neuro-cognitive assessments for elderly people (including visual impaired people).
