# short description of the publication
description: "On the left, is a photo taken from the preliminary study. One of the groups is listening to the message recorded by the other, which is transmitted by the robot. The robot is on a table and participants are around it. At the bottom of the table is the computer, whose screen displays the images of the group that sent the robot. The two groups of older adults are in different rooms and are able to see each other through the computers. On the right, an example of a sequence, using the snap-on blocks. The first block in the sequence is the Play Block, used to actually trigger the actions. The Action Blocks in the image are the Record Block, represented by a block with a microphone and the Greet Block, a block with an open hand. The last block is used to target the other group involved. Blocks are 3D printed and painted. Different colours for different blocks are used to make interaction more intuitive."
