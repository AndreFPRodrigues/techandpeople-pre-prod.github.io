# short description of the publication
description: We sought to understand how sighted and blind people instruct other blind users to accomplish tasks on a mobile device. We also studied how those instructions enabled blind people to be successful. Results showed that a single pass of instructions was limited. A set of ways in which support can be provided is discussed.
