# short description of the publication
description: We sought to understand how sighted and blind people instruct other blind users to accomplish tasks on a mobile device. We also studied how those instructions enabled blind people to be successful. Results showed that a single pass of instructions was limited. A set of ways in which support can be provided is discussed.

## Abstract
Mobile device users are required to constantly learn to use
new apps, features, and adapt to updates. For blind people, adapting
to a new interface requires additional time and effort. At the limit, and
often so, devices and applications may become unusable without support from someone else. Using tutorials is a common approach to foster
independent learning of new concepts and workflows. However, most tutorials available online are limited in scope, detail, or quickly become
outdated. Also, they presume a degree of tech savviness that is not at
the reach of the common mobile device user. Our research explores the
democratization of assistance by enabling non-technical people to create
tutorials in their mobile phones for others. We report on the interaction
and information needs of blind people when following ’amateur’ tutorials.
Thus, providing insights into how to widen and improve the authoring
and playthrough of these learning artifacts. We conducted a study where
12 blind users followed tutorials previously created by blind or sighted
people. Our findings suggest that instructions authored by sighted and
blind people are limited in different aspects, and that those limitations
prevent effective learning of the task at hand. We identified the types of
contents produced by authors and the information required by followers during playthrough, which often do not align. We provide insights
on how to support both authoring and playthrough of nonvisual smartphone tutorials. There is an opportunity to design solutions that mediate
authoring, combine contributions, adapt to user profile, react to context
and are living artifacts capable of perpetual improvement.
