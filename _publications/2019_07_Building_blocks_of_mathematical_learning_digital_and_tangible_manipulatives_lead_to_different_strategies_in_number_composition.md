# short description of the publication
description: "It is indispensable that objects may be grasped, lifted and explored or would it be enough to interact with virtual manipulatives? And specifically, how the objects’ affordances (i.e., the possibility to grasp physical objects or drag virtual ones) will shape and constrain children’s composing strategies."
