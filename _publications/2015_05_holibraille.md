description: "HoliBraille is a system capable of localized vibrotactile feedback that can be combined with the input capabilities of mobile devices. We used a custom-made case and off-the-shelf vibrotactile actuators combined with dampening materials. The solution can be attached to mainstream touchscreen devices enabling direct feedback on users’ fingers. In this paper, we contribute the following: 1) some application scenarios that can benefit from HoliBraille; 2) the design and technical description of the proposed device; and 3) an evaluation of HoliBraille on a foundational task for future Braille-related applications, i.e. character discrimination.# short description of the publication
